Question 1
Given two strings s and t, determine whether some anagram of t is a substring of s.
For example: if s = "udacity" and t = "ad", then the function returns True.
Your function definition should look like: question1(s, t) and return a boolean True or False.

Solution:
By assuming that the string input is ASCII so the max value will be 256,
Then compare a counter by maintaining a window of target input size

Validation:
- t > s => false
- t is None => false, s is None => false
- t and s E string

Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
