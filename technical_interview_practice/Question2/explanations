Question 2
Given a string a, find the longest palindromic substring contained in a.
Your function definition should look like question2(a), and return a string.

Solution:
- dynamic programming
- create a matrix of size n x n
- for each string of size 1 there will be max palindrome of size 1
- the for window size 2, if the 1st and last characters are the same
- check if the the inner characters are the same ==> which is computed from the last tem
- therefore, we sum the last max palindrome length + 2
- and check if the length larger that the max len that we reached so far
- and update the longest substring accordingly

Complexity:
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n^2)

Validation:
- input is empty
- input is of size 1

Test cases:
- "bananas" is "anana"
- "babad" is "bab"
- "cbbd" is "bb"
